Lair (Learning Artificial Intelligence with Rust) is a set of implementation
exercises I use to demonstrate (to myself) gaps in my understanding in
machine learning -- at least linear regression and deep learning so far.

There are some simple benchmarks I use for run-time (convergence) performance
produced by

```
CRITERIUM_DEBUG=1 cargo bench
```
